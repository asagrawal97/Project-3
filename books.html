      <div class="cover">
        <h4 class="title"><em>A Discovery of Witches</em> by Deborah Harkenss</h4>
        <img src="pics/witch.jpg" alt="A Discovery of Witches">
      </div>
      <div class="witch">
        <p>This book is about Diana Bishop, a Yale professor conducting research at the University of Oxford. She is also a witch, though she prefers to forget about that part of her life and limits her interaction with other witches. She discovers a lost manuscript at the Bodleian Library which attracts the attention of others who have been searching for the manuscript. Here, she meets Matthew Clairmont, a vampire. This book is about Diana discovering herself, friends and enemies in the magical community of witches, vampires and demons.</p>

        <h4 class="title"><em>Magic Bites</em> by Ilona Andrews</h4>
        <img src="pics/magic.jpg" alt="Magic Bites">
      </div>
      <div class="magic">
        <p>This has to be my favorite series ever. It managed to dislodge <em>Harry Potter</em> from the first place where it had been collecting dust for a decade. <em>Magic Bites</em> is completely unique book. It takes place in a world where magic and technology exist together. When magic worked, technology wouldn't and when technology worked, magic wouldn't. Kate Daniels is also the perfect heroine ever. She's sarcastic and hilarious and completely awesome. There are supernatural creatures you've never even heard and not just your normal werewolves and vampires. I'd also like to warn you not to read this book in a public setting, because you'll end up laughing so hard, people will think you're crazy.</p>

        <h4 class="title"><em>Darkfever</em> by Karen Marie Moning</h4>
        <img src="pics/dark.jpg" alt="Darkfever">
      </div>
      <div class="fever">
        <p>If it's not absolutely clear yet that I love fantasy novels, here's another one. Darkfever uses Irish folklore, something I've never read in a book. It's the story of the fae people, commonly known as fairies. Now, don't get me wrong, these are the "Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo" turn the pumpkin into a carraige kinds. These are killer fae with a massive grudge against humans. Mac is another strong-willed power heroine in an action packed, fast paced series. I read the first 9 books in 2 weeks, just to give you an idea of the addiction.</p>
