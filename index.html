        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Akshita and I'm a third year transfer student, majoring in ITM. I transferred from College of DuPage last semester, where I studied for 4 semesters. COD was also where I got to join the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.</p>
        <p>As an international student, I was unable to work or get an internship, but I finally got my work authorization and now I'm looking for a part-time job or an internship. Instead, I've been volunteering my time at the local public library.</p>
        <p>Most of my free time is spent reading. I'm an avid reader of all genres, but my favorites are mysteries and fantasy books. My current obsession is the <em>Furies of Calderon</em> series by Jim Butcher. My other hobbies include cooking, baking and travelling.</p>
